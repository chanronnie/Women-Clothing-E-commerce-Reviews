# Women Clothing-E Commerce Reviews
In this project, I will conduct a `data analysis` on a Women's Clothing E-Commerce platform using the **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries in **Python**. Following this, I will perform a `sentiment analysis` on the product reviews using the **NLTK** package, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier** and **Naive Bayes**.


## ❔About Dataset
The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews). The author has mentionned that the name of the E-commerce platform will not be disclosed. To maintain the anonymity of the real-world shop, it is referred to as 'retailer' in the dataset.

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row represents customer's purchase along with the review they posted on the E-commerce site.
